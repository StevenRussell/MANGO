# MANGO

The MANGO (Modelling an Alternative Nutrition Protocol Generalizable for Outpatient) project is a randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial assessing the optimal dosage of ready-to-use therapeutic foods for the treatment of severe acute malnutrition (WHZ < -3 and/or MUAC < 115 mm without oedema or other complications requiring inpatient treatment). A total of 800 children aged 6-59 months were admitted to outpatient treatment.
